## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In this project, we are tasked to build a chatbot system for the ISS website. The purpose of this chatbot would be to answer enquiries related to ISS programs, courses, and related information. This project serves to leverage the techniques learned in the Cognitive Systems course.
We employed the Dialogflow agent for this implementation together with a Python program and its associated libraries. This combination provides the capability for two levels of response, first is a fulfillment from the Python program, and second is Dialogflow. 
This project gives the team an opportunity to convert our learning into practical use. In this case, providing a way for users to interactively use the ISS website.

It equips the attendee with the necessary skillsets to design sentiment analysis system and apply them in various social fields. The ability to process and analyse voluminous textual data provides the participants an edge in this new media age. The objective of this course is to introduce participants to sentiment analysis and its applications. Participants will gain the requisite skills to evaluate the supervised learning algorithms for sentiment classification. They will be able to evaluate and analyse granular meaning of texts from documents and articles. The course will assume that the participants have good knowledge of text analytics and techniques, and some hands on experience of modelling using these techniques using Python. Participants are also expected to have knowledge of statistics at the level of the NICF - Statistics Bootcamp (SF) course.

                            "Business Analytics has earned a place as one of the core disruptors of the digital age. Many companies\u2019 business analytics initiatives have moved to production, with some proven success, and now there is a continuing push to leverage new data technologies to power business intelligence. Many government agencies and private companies have jumped on this bandwagon and are heavily investing in business analytics projects to gain new insights in order to acquire a competitive edge to serve their customers and citizens. According to Gartner Research, the worldwide market for analytics will remain the top focus for CIOs through 2017. This report cited that more than 30% of organisations have invested in analysing \u201cbig data\u201d but only a quarter (8% of the total) have made it into production! It remains as a major challenge for those tasked to deliver and implement these analytical capabilities and programmes successfully. This course brings together latest thinking and best practices from the various domains of Agile, Lean and Traditional project management to equip business analytics teams with the knowledge and skills to effectively and successfully manage business analytics projects. Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 19.25 PDUs (Technical: 11.5, Leadership: 5, Strategy: 2.75) that can be used to maintain your PMP\u00ae credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP\u00ae credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is \u201c2339\u201d."

Do you want to extract meaningful opinions and sentiments from these textual data automatically? This course further extends the knowledge and skillsets built by the NICF - Text Analytics (SF) course. It equips the attendee with the necessary skillsets to design sentiment analysis system and apply them in various social fields. The ability to process and analyse voluminous textual data provides the participants an edge in this new media age. The objective of this course is to introduce participants to sentiment analysis and its applications. Participants will gain the requisite skills to evaluate the supervised learning algorithms for sentiment classification. They will be able to evaluate and analyse granular meaning of texts from documents and articles. The course will assume that the participants have good knowledge of text analytics and techniques, and some hands on experience of modelling using these techniques using Python. Participants are also expected to have knowledge of statistics at the level of the NICF - Statistics Bootcamp (SF) course. This course is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Graduate Certificate in Practical Language Processing Series offered by NUS-ISS."

                            "In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of \u2018Secure by Design\u2019 practices.",
                            "Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment.",
                            "Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.",
                            "Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints.",
                            "The objective of this course is to instill \u2018Secure by Design\u2019 practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.",

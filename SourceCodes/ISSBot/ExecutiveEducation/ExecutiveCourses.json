This continuous streaming of information must be coupled with a means to analyse the data and create the corresponding analytics models, and put these models back to the edge nodes in IoT network. Given the fast pace of change to connected devices and the perspective of data science, one needs to understand and explore feature engineering of IoT or sensor data.",

Many companies\u2019 business analytics initiatives have moved to production, with some proven success, and now there is a continuing push to leverage new data technologies to power business intelligence. Many government agencies and private companies have jumped on this bandwagon and are heavily investing in business analytics projects to gain new insights in order to acquire a competitive edge to serve their customers and citizens. According to Gartner Research, the worldwide market for analytics will remain the top focus for CIOs through 2017. This report cited that more than 30% of organisations have invested in analysing \u201cbig data\u201d but only a quarter (8% of the total) have made it into production! It remains as a major challenge for those tasked to deliver and implement these analytical capabilities and programmes successfully. This course brings together latest thinking and best practices from the various domains of Agile, Lean and Traditional project management to equip business analytics teams with the knowledge and skills to effectively and successfully manage business analytics projects. Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 19.25 PDUs (Technical: 11.5, Leadership: 5, Strategy: 2.75) that can be used to maintain your PMP\u00ae credential.

This 3-day introductory course focuses on the principles and techniques in the design of good user experience in software applications. It traverses through the requirement, analysis, design and validation phases of the user experience design life cycle with emphasis on building empathy with users. Case scenarios, examples, exercises and workshops will be used throughout the course for participants to individually experience and reflect on what is good and bad UX design. Designing for applications is about more than just usability. It is also about how well a particular application is able to relate, interact and serve for a meaningful experience. Good user experience encourages a higher engagement rate and sustained use of the applications. It also renders a beneficial experience for the user, which can lead to an increase in productivity. Bad user experience often leads to a myriad of issues and arguably one of the most damaging, is to the organisation\u2019s or company\u2019s image.

                "Business Processing Reengineering (BPR), as defined by Michael Hammer, is the fundamental re-thinking and radical redesign of business processes to bring about dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service and speed. With the resurgence of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) fuelled by machine intelligence, BPR is again centre stage as many companies will need to rethink their existing business processes in the light of digital transformation prior to automating it. ISS is recognised as the most established institution with experience in offering the BPR course, having trained more than 10,000 people in Singapore over the past two decades. Participants have leveraged BPR to impact many industries including finance, healthcare, logistics and government. This course is taught by highly experienced instructors, who are former consultants from leading consulting firms with more than 10 years of experience in running BPR projects.",
                "In this course, participants will learn why BPR is in demand, when to and when not to use BPR and more importantly, how to do it effectively and successfully. Beyond just theory, you will benefit from rich class notes and unique case studies. You will also benefit from the sharing of real-life scenarios, tips and techniques to help you avoid the many pitfalls of BPR and how to overcome the many challenges when implementing it.",

                "As organisations are highly dependent on IT to drive many business processes, the need for regulatory compliance and risks mitigation is made even more crucial. As the most widely used international framework of best practices for IT governance, Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT\u00ae) lets you bridge the gaps among control requirements, technical issues and business risks. The COBIT\u00ae Certificate course is a 3-day programme that introduces you to the fundamentals of the COBIT\u00ae governance framework for IT. It covers topics required for the foundation certification and also relates the fundamentals of COBIT to real world examples. A workshop and mock examination give you guided practice in applying COBIT to a case scenario and preparation for the certification examination. Past participants include IT Managers from public and private organisations in Singapore and abroad, providing good networking opportunities and experience sharing. With the publication of the latest version - COBIT 5 - ISACA has taken the opportunity to update the framework for the current challenges facing organisations, as well as standardising and simplifying the COBIT structure. The course instructors are COBIT\u00ae certified and are experienced in implementing COBIT\u00ae in private and public sector organisations.

                "With Singapore\u2019s push towards international connectivity and the pervasive adoption of digital technologies as recommended by Committee on Future Economy (CFE), we inadvertently expand our cyber attack surface. Singaporean organisations and Singapore citizens are thus more exposed to global threats posed by cyber threats \u2013 from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety. In today\u2019s digital business environment, cyber attacks can cripple the entire business operations if an organisation is unprepared. Investing in cybersecurity technology alone is insufficient to address cyber threats. Creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises cybersecurity is a must for the entire organisation, and with business/operational leaders taking the lead is now an imperative.",

In addition, it provides a detailed prescriptive framework which includes Incident Response Plan (using industry best practices) and a Cyber Maturity Model, instead of knowledge sharing without an approach to application. How public and private enterprises can play a role in ensuring that Singapore remain cyber resilience will also be discussed.",
